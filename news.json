        "description": "Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit on Friday revealed that a \"sophisticated\" attack led to the theft of over $1.46 billion worth of cryptocurrency from one of its Ethereum cold (offline) wallets, making it the largest ever single crypto heist in history.  \"The incident occurred when our ETH multisig cold wallet executed  a transfer to our warm wallet. Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing interface, displaying the correct address while altering the underlying smart contract logic,\" Bybit said  in a post on X.  \"As a result, the attacker was able to gain control of the affected ETH cold wallet and transfer its holdings to an unidentified address.\"   In a separate statement posted on the social media platform, Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou emphasized  that all other cold wallets are secure. The company further said  it has reported the case to the appropriate authorities.  While there is no official con...",

        "description": "OpenAI on Friday revealed  that it banned a set of accounts that used its ChatGPT tool to develop a suspected artificial intelligence (AI)-powered surveillance tool.  The social media listening tool is said to likely originate from China and is powered by one of Meta's Llama models , with the accounts in question using the AI company's models to generate detailed descriptions and analyze documents for an apparatus capable of collecting real-time data and reports about anti-China protests in the West and sharing the insights with Chinese authorities.  The campaign has been codenamed Peer Review owing to the \"network's behavior in promoting and reviewing surveillance tooling,\" researchers Ben Nimmo, Albert Zhang, Matthew Richard, and Nathaniel Hartley noted, adding the tool is designed to ingest and analyze posts and comments from platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, and Reddit.  In one instance flagged by the company, the actors used ChatG...",

        "description": "Apple is removing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for iCloud from the United Kingdom with immediate effect following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data.  The development was first reported  by Bloomberg.  ADP for iCloud is an optional setting  that ensures that users' trusted devices retain sole access to the encryption keys used to unlock data stored in its cloud. This includes iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, voice memos, and data associated with its own apps.   \"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" the company was quoted as saying to Bloomberg.  \"ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices.\"  Customers who are already using ADP ...",

Founded in 1995, TopSec ostensibly offers services such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning. But it's also providing \"boutique\" solutions in order to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements, SentinelOne researchers Alex Delamotte and Aleksandar Milenkoski said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The data leak contains infrastructure details and work logs from employees, as well as references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.  It's believed that the company provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise hit by a corruption scandal, indicating that such platforms are being used to monitor and control public...",

The latest iteration of the phishing suite \"represents a significant shift in criminal capabilities, reducing the barrier to entry for bad actors to target any brand with complex, customizable phishing campaigns,\" Netcraft said  in a new analysis.   The cybersecurity company said it has detected and blocked more than 95,000 new Darcula phishing domains, nearly 31,000 IP addresses, and taken down more than 20,000 fraudulent websites since it was first exposed  in late March 2024.

        "description": "AI is everywhere now, transforming how businesses operate and how users engage with apps, devices, and services. A lot of applications now have some Artificial Intelligence inside, whether supporting a chat interface, intelligently analyzing data or matching user preferences. No question AI benefits users, but it also brings new security challenges, especially Identity-related security challenges. Let's explore what these challenges are and what you can do to face them with Okta. Which AI? Everyone talks about AI, but this term is very general, and several technologies fall under this umbrella. For example, symbolic AI uses technologies such as logic programming, expert systems, and semantic networks. Other approaches use neural networks, Bayesian networks, and other tools. Newer Generative AI uses Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLM) as core technologies to generate content such as text, images, video, audio, etc. Many of the applications we use most often toda...",

Travel back in time to 515 BC and read the Behistun Inscription, an autobiography by Persian King Darius that discusses his rise to power. More recently, see how different newspapers report on wars, where it's said, 'The first casualty is the truth.'\u00a0  While these forms of communication could shape people's beliefs, they also carry limitations around scalability. Any messaging and propaganda would often lose its power after traveling a certain distance. Of course, with social media and the online world there are few physical limits on reach, apart from where someone's internet connection drops. Add in the rise of AI, and there's also nothing to stop the scalability either.\u00a0  This article explores what this means for societies and organizations facing  AI-powered information manipulation  and deception.
